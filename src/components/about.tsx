        <span className="font-medium">web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        power of creating things. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack

        constantly learning and adapting.
